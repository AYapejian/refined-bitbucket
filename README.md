# refined-bitbucket
We all know Bitbucket lacks some features that we find lovely in GitHub and in our minds.
That's why, based on Sindre Sorhus' [Refined Github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github)
extension I created this project.
It's a chrome extension that improves the Bitbucket interface.

## Current features
- Improves syntax highlight for pull requests
