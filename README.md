# refined-bitbucket
We all know Bitbucket lacks some features that we find lovely in GitHub and in our minds.
And based on Sindre Sorhus' [Refined Github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github)
extension I had the idea of improving BitBucket's user interface.
In fact, [Rodrigo Proença](https://github.com/rproenca) did most of the code. Kudos!

## Current features
- Improves syntax highlight for pull requests. Enabled languages:
  - Markup, C-like languages, Go, Handlebars, JSON, Markdown, Python, React JSX, Ruby, Sass, Swift and YAML. I decided to add the most common languages, but it can be easily improved if necessary.

## Install
I haven't published the extension in the Web Store yet (icon needed and other things), but it's already possible to use it.
You just need to do the steps listed [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

## Contribute
Clone the repo, run *npm install* and start tweaking. :)
